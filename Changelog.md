### v1.1 (21-Dec-2018)

- Improved UI in all screens.
- Limited the number of concurrent downloads and added an option in settings to configure it.
- Last used download format is now persisted so you don't have to select it all the time.
- Fixed an issue where temporary files were not deleted after the download was canceled. The underlying issue was fixed in YoutubeExplode.Converter v1.0.3 and CliWrap v2.2.
- Fixed an issue where starting multiple downloads would cause them to be added in the wrong order to the list of downloads.
